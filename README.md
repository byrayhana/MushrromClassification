# Mushroom Classification using Transfer Learning with ResNet50

This project aims to classify images of mushrooms into different classes using transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture. The dataset used in this project contains images of mushrooms belonging to different species.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains images of mushrooms from various species. The dataset is organized into folders, where each folder represents a different mushroom species. The images are in JPEG format and are resized to 224x224 pixels.

This dataset has been prepared by applying augmentation techniques to the mushroom dataset available on Kaggle, which contains 9 classes of mushrooms. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/esmabaer/mushrooms3). The dataset includes images of various mushroom species.
